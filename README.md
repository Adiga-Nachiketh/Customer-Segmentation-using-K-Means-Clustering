# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This repository contains a machine learning project on customer segmentation using the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm. The project was implemented in **Google Colab** and aims to segment customers based on features such as spending and income, using a dataset sourced from Kaggle.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Customer Segmentation Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) 
- **Description**: The dataset includes various customer features such as income, spending scores, and other demographics, making it suitable for clustering customers into different segments.
- **Features**:
  - Customer demographics such as income and spending score.
  - Other behavioral or demographic information, depending on the specific dataset used.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Google Colab** for implementing and running the clustering model.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**:
  - `scikit-learn` for building and evaluating the K-Means clustering model.
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization and cluster plotting.

## Project Details

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Data was cleaned, and relevant features were scaled or transformed as needed.
   - Steps were taken to handle any missing values or outliers in the dataset.

### 2. **Model Development**:
   - **K-Means Clustering** was chosen for this project as itâ€™s a popular unsupervised learning algorithm for segmentation.
   - The **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** were used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

### 3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - After choosing the number of clusters, the model's results were visualized to interpret the distinct customer segments.
   - Clusters were analyzed based on characteristics like average income, spending score, and demographic similarities.

### 4. **Conclusion**:
   - The project successfully segmented customers into clusters that can help businesses better understand customer behavior.
   - These insights can be applied in marketing, customer relationship management, and targeted promotions.

## Usage

To run this project:
1. Open the notebook `Customer_Segmentation_KMeans.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Execute the cells in order to see the data preprocessing, model training, and cluster visualization steps.
